# Meditation app 
For this React project I wanted to explore Firebase for storage, authentication and authorization. I also wanted to practice implementing a headless CMS to handle new content for the site, as well as revisit Cypress for some testing.

Users can track their progress and see details about their previous meditations üèÜ and also save favorite meditations ‚ù§Ô∏è
