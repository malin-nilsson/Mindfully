# Meditation app 
For this React project I wanted to explore creating storage, authentication and authorization using Firebase and I also wanted to implement a headless CMS to handle new content for the site.

Users can track their progress and see details about their previous meditations üèÜ and also save favorite meditations ‚ù§Ô∏è. End-to-end tests were implemented using Cypress.
