# Meditation app 
For this React project I wanted to practice storage, authentication and authorization using Firebase and I also wanted to implement a headless CMS to upload new content to the site.

Users can track their progress and see details about their previous meditations 🏆 and also save favorite meditations ❤️. End-to-end tests were implemented using Cypress.
